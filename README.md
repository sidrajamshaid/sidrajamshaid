- 👋 Hi, I’m @sidrajamshaid
- 👀 I’m interested in turning raw data into insights, creating visualizations that make people go "wow," and exploring the magic of Python for analytics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data analytics with Python, mastering pandas, numpy, and figuring out how to tame messy datasets like a pro.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve data wrangling, cool dashboards, or uncovering trends hidden in the noise. Got messy data? Let’s clean it up together!
- 📫 How to reach me:connect with me on https://www.linkedin.com/in/sidrajamshaid/. I’m always up for a chat (or a data debate).
- 😄 Pronouns: Sidra
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can spend hours debugging a code snippet but still can’t figure out why I always run out of coffee.
